# Constitution
Southampton Robotics Outreach Constitution

The canonical version of the constitution is the LaTeX source held in this repository.
A PDF version is automatically built by [GitHub 
Actions](https://github.com/roboticsoutreach/constitution/actions)  and is available as a 
build artifact.
It can also be built locally by cloning the repository and running `make` in the `latex` subdirectory.
